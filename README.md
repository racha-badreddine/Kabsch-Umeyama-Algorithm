# Kabsch-Umeyama-Algorithm
In this project, I have implemented the Kabsch-Umeyama Algorithm and tested it on multiple datasets. The algorithm is essential for finding the optimal rotation matrix that minimizes the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between two sets of points.

Additionally, the project aims to implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from scratch, I chose the QR Method to achieve this. The SVD is a crucial step in the Kabsch-Umeyama Algorithm, enabling us to compute the necessary transformation matrices.
